<!--- Dear Professor,
    I partially completed the assignment. Since, the concept of javascript is new for me, it took me more than two
     hours to complete it. I was referring for every part of the problem. while doing so, I learnt how to use
     loops, how to add element to an array, how to use a function and so on.
